Overview:

This example shows a simple pricing gateway set up that demonstrates the following:

* A trivial implementation of a gateway with command line client
and backend pricing engine and asynchronous gateway listeners.

* The gateway and the pricing engine are written in Scala for its
async behaviours and use OSGi declarative services as the component
model.

* There is a simple blueprint persistence gateway listener written in
Java that takes quotes/requests and writes them to disk

* The command line is a Java OSGi bundle

* The remote communications are pluggable via RSA but the demo will
default to using SLP for discovery and EssenceRMI for the transport.

* Systems and repositories used to deploy the components on the fabric.

Source:

The source is split up into the following directories:

* gateway.api - shared Java api for components
* gateway.persistence - blueprint persistence component
* gateway.cli - simple osgi shell
* gateway.pricer - scala pricing engine using declarative services
* gateway.scripts - scripts to launch components in nimble
* gateway.system - systems to deploy components in fabric

Build:

All the dependencies are packaged with this example so just run ant from the top level gateway directory

$ cd $examples
$ ant -f gateway.build/build.xml
